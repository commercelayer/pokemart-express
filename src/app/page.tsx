                  Welcome to PokéMart Express, where we are pushing the
                  boundaries of e-commerce by demonstrating that you can
                  commercify anything – even Pokémon! In this experimental
                  project, we are showcasing the versatility of Commerce Layer,
                  proving that you can build a fully functional online store
                  without the need for a traditional CMS. Dive into our digital
                  playground, where every pixel is a testament to the endless
                  possibilities of headless commerce.

                  Please note that PokéMart Express is a test environment, and
                  no actual purchases can be made. So feel free to explore,
                  collect, and interact with our Pokémon-themed products, all
                  while discovering the power of headless commerce. Join us on
                  this exciting journey as we redefine the future of online
                  shopping, one Poké Ball at a time!
